                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>Ugarit was an important sea port city in the Northern Levant.<br> Though never a world power, Ugarit was
                    a key economic center in the Ancient Near East, serving as a major trade center between Egypt and the
                    major powers of Bronze Age Asia Minor and Mesopotamia.<br><br>
                    Though Ugarit had been inhabited almost continuously since the Neolithic period (c. 6500 BCE), it was
                    not until c.1900 BCE that Ugarit begins to establish itself as a major center of trade.<br>
                    Ugarit's importance was rooted not in its military prowess, but in its political and economic
                    prgamatism. Geographically, Ugarit was perfectly situated to serve as a trade center between Egypt,
                    Mesopotamia, and Cyprus.
                    The earliest recorded treaty found at Ugarit, between Ugarit and Amurru (in modern day Lebanon),
                    illustrates this pragmatism perfectly.<br><br><br>
                    Unfortunately, due to the combined pressure of the steady collapse of the palace-temple economy due to
                    the ruralization of the Ugaritic countryside, and the migration of the Sea Peoples from the west, Ugarit
                    collapsed by the middle of the twelfth century BCE.<br><br><br></p>
