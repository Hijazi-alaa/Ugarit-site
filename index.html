                <p>
                    Ugarit was an important sea port city in the Northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about levant(opens in a new tab)">Levant</a>.<br> Though never a world power, Ugarit was
                    a key economic center in the Ancient Near East, serving as a major trade center between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Egypt(opens in a new tab)">Egypt</a> and the
                    major powers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Bronze Age (opens in a new tab)">Bronze Age</a> Asia Minor and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Mesopotamia(opens in a new tab)">Mesopotamia</a>.<br><br>
                    Though Ugarit had been inhabited almost continuously since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Neolithic(opens in a new tab)">Neolithic</a> period (c. 6500 BCE), it was
                    not until c.1900 BCE that Ugarit begins to establish itself as a major center of trade.<br>
                    Ugarit's importance was rooted not in its military prowess, but in its political and economic
                    prgamatism. Geographically, Ugarit was perfectly situated to serve as a trade center between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Egypt(opens in a new tab)">Egypt</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Mesopotamia(opens in a new tab)">Mesopotamia</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Cyprus(opens in a new tab)">Cyprus</a>.
                    The earliest recorded treaty found at Ugarit, between Ugarit and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amurru_kingdom" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Amurru kingdom(opens in a new tab)">Amurru</a>,
                    illustrates this pragmatism perfectly.<br><br><br>
                    Unfortunately, due to the combined pressure of the steady collapse of the palace-temple economy due to
                    the ruralization of the Ugaritic countryside, and the migration of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Sea Peoples(opens in a new tab)">Sea Peoples</a> from the west, Ugarit
                    collapsed by the middle of the twelfth century BCE.<br><br><br>

                    After its destruction in the early 12th century BC,[18] Ugarit's location was forgotten until 1928 when
                    a peasant accidentally opened an old tomb while ploughing a field.<br>The discovered area was the
                    necropolis of Ugarit located in the nearby seaport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minet_el-Beida" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Minet el-Beida(opens in a new tab)">Minet el-Beida</a> (10 kilometers north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latakia" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Latakia(opens in a new tab)">Latakia</a>,

                <p>
                    Archaeologists have found clay tablets in the city of Ugarit that provide the earliest examples of a
                    written <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about alphabet(opens in a new tab)">alphabet</a>. The question is, does this mean that Ugarit was the place this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about alphabet(opens in a new tab)">alphabet</a> developed?<br>
                    Before the development of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about alphabet(opens in a new tab)">alphabet</a>, there were two primary forms of writing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuneiform" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about cuneiform(opens in a new tab)">cuneiform</a> and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Egyptian hieroglyphs(opens in a new tab)">Egyptian hieroglyphics</a>.
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuneiform" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about cuneiform(opens in a new tab)">Cuneiform</a> consisted of a series of symbols impressed into clay tablets with the end of a
                    stylus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyph" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Hieroglyphs(opens in a new tab)">Hieroglyphs</a> used straightforward pictures.
                    Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuneiform" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about cuneiform(opens in a new tab)">cuneiform</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyph" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Hieroglyphs(opens in a new tab)">hieroglyphics</a> relied on a series of pictographic symbols to convey ideas. However,
                    both systems were complex because of the sheer number of symbols involved.<br><br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuneiform" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about cuneiform(opens in a new tab)">Cuneiform</a> symbols ran
                    into the hundreds, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about alphabet(opens in a new tab)">alphabet</a> on the other hand, is much simpler. By definition, it is a system that
                    relies upon a limited number of letters, listed in a fixed order, each with a specific and fixed sound.
                    The limit on the number of letters in use means that it is easier to use and so more accessible to the
                    general population.</p>
                    <br><br><figure id="alphabet-image"><img src="assets/images/alphabet.jpg" alt="alphabet-tablet"><figcaption>Tablet of the Ugaritic Alphabet</figcaption></figure><br><br>
                <p>
                    The first lists of letters that can be deemed alphabetic date to between the 14th and 12th centuries BC
                    and were discovered in Ugarit, this is the earliest example of a written <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about alphabet(opens in a new tab)">alphabet</a>, which has led to
                    speculate that the system was developed in Ugarit.<br>
                    How the Ugaritic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about alphabet(opens in a new tab)">alphabet</a> developed is unknown. Some scholars believe it was a unique innovation, a
                    genuine attempt to simplify cuneiform. <br>Others think that because Ugarit's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about alphabet(opens in a new tab)">alphabet</a> was not found
                    outside the city, it represented a localized development from an earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_people" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Semitic people(opens in a new tab)">Semitic</a> alphabetic system.<br>
                    There is also a school of thought that believes the Ugaritic alphabet could have been influenced by the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Phoenician alphabet(opens in a new tab)">Phoenician alphabet</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Phoenician alphabet(opens in a new tab)">Phoenician alphabet</a> was the precursor of the systems used later by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Ancient Greece(opens in a new tab)">Greeks</a>
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Ancient Rome(opens in a new tab)">Romans</a>.<br><br> However, the earliest known inscription of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Phoenician alphabet(opens in a new tab)">Phoenician alphabet</a> is 500 years
                    later than that of Ugarit. <br>Based on this evidence, it is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic_alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Ugaritic alphabet(opens in a new tab)">Ugaritic alphabet</a>, rather than
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Phoenicia(opens in a new tab)">Phoenician</a>, that is the first ancestor of all alphabets.
                    Ugarit was the ideal location for such innovation to occur. It was a nexus of international trade, and
                    its records show the numerous different languages and systems of writing to which its merchants were
                    exposed. So, it was the perfect place for someone to experiment with ways to record information in a
                    simpler form- and for other people to pick up on the idea and develop their own alphabetic way of
                    writing.<br> The evidence suggests that even though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic_alphabet" class="wiki-definition" target="blank_" rel="noopener" aria-label="wikipedia page about Ugaritic alphabet(opens in a new tab)">Ugaritic alphabet</a> did not spread in its original
                    form beyond the city of its creation, its principles, such as the fixed set of symbols including vowels
                    and consonants did seem to have continued and influenced other systems.
